# Group Project Three

University final group project for the CSDE (Computer Science Development Exercise) module.

## How to
- Folders
   - *The documentation folder just stores the original copies of the assignment documentation and doesn't require changing*
   - *The to-submit folder is the folder that will be submitted once the assignment is complete*
   - *Changes can be worked on in the outsstanding-work branch, and committed to the master-branch via a pull request when ready*

* Select the *Branch: Master* and change into the *outstanding-work* branch. Download the file you wish to change, once the changes have     been made, re-upload into the outstanding-work branch with the same file name, updating the changes made from the old file.
* Once the file is complete, a pull request can be opened to add the file to the master branch, from the outstanding work branch.


## Tasks

-	Read all the documentation, especially User Stories & Client Priorities

-	Identify an overall project plan, and produce an initial Data Model (E-R diagram)

- Decide on priorities. Produce Sprint Cycle1 Plan. Get it signed by the Sprint Master
   Carry out the planned the tasks, including:
  - [ ]	produce test plan/s 
  -	[ ] develop your software
  -	[ ]	test your software against the test plan using client sample data 
  -	[ ]	review, make any corrections, re-test, and repeat.
  - [ ]	At the end of Sprint Cycle 1 evaluate what has been achieved and identify what still  needs to be done. Use this to decide on aims for Sprint Cycle 2:

- Decide on priorities. Produce Sprint Cycle2 Plan. Get it signed by the Sprint Master

  -	[ ]	produce test plan/s 
  -	[ ]	develop your software
  -	[ ]	test your software against the test plan using client sample data 
  -	[ ]	review, make any corrections, re-test, and repeat.
  - [ ]	At the end of Sprint Cycle 2 evaluate what has been achieved and identify what still  needs to be done. Use this to decide on aims for Sprint Cycle 3:
  
- Decide on priorities. Produce Sprint Cycle3 Plan. Get it signed by the Sprint Master
Carry out the planned the tasks, including:
  - [ ]	produce test plan/s 
  - [ ]	develop your software
  - [ ]	test your software against the test plan using client sample data 
  - [ ]	review, make any corrections, re-test, and repeat.
  - [ ]	At the end of Sprint Cycle 3 evaluate what has been achieved and identify what still needs to be done. By this stage you should have completed GP3

- Produce the deliverables for the coursework hand-in:
  - [ ]	your database design documentation (ERD and data dictionary) (printed copy);
  - [ ]	your software, including the specimen test data (on a USB);
  - [ ]	test that your software works on the lab PCs (Windows 7 and Firefox)
  - [ ]	your 3 sprint cycles plans, signed & evaluated
  - [ ]	test plans & sprint cycles

- Sign the Assignment Front Sheet. All individual team members who contributed must do so; no signature means no mark.

-	Complete the GP3 Roles and Contributions Form(s) for submission.

-	Package your solution with the completed Assignment Front Sheet and Roles & Contributions Form in a transparent plastic folder with   your team id clearly visible and the USB securely stored inside.

-	Submit to CS Reception:  Your coursework by 01/04/18 11.00am

- Submit to StudyNet: ONE zipped file containing ALL of your key files for the demo, including your software, database, and demo        slides (but not the EasyPHP platform). ONLY ONE submission per team is required
  - [ ]	it will only be used for backup or quality assurance purposes;
  - [ ]	responsibility for this submission is with the team as a whole

- Prepare for the demo:
  - [ ]	establish the time and the place for your demo and ensure all team members attend; non-attendance means no marks for the      individual;
  - [ ]	allocate roles (who will click through the system for the software demo, and who is speaking during the presentation).	

- Produce the deliverables for the demo:
  - [ ]	bring your presentation slides, and be ready to display/present;
  - [ ]	be expected to load your software (submitted USB) on a lab machine during the demo as instructed by staff

-	Attend the demo. Then it’s all over! Wait for the written feedback, due after all the demos have finished. Use the experience you   have gained to help pass the exam, do well in your final year project, and get a job in software development!
